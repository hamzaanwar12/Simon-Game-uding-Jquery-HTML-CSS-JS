The JS file is based on the JQuery so please while using this repo make sure that you add cdn for Jquery or install it in our system give it path on the script file Like i have added in the HTML file as a dummy :
  <script src="../../../jsQuery/jquery-3.6.3.js"></script>
Change rc to your path if you have instaled JQuery otherwise use cdn and provide link in html file and remove the <script src="../../../jsQuery/jquery-3.6.3.js"></script> tag
